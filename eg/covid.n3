CoEpi is a privacy-first system for anonymous Bluetooth-based contact
tracing / exposure matching based on voluntary symptom sharing and/or
confirmed COVID-19 test results. Communities of close contacts can
begin protecting themselves with CoEpi immediately; there is no scale
required to achieve benefit to closed user groups.

Our team at MIT, working with partners from around the world, has
developed a system for identifying people at risk of infecting
COVID-19, by using the Bluetooth signals that our cell phones send
each other. Privacy is a bedrock value so our system can notify
individuals of potential contacts without revealing any private
information to other individuals, the government, health care
providers, or cell service providers.

Are the periodic (~7 day) spikes of mortality in @TheWashingtonPost's
reported US deaths statistically "real" or are they artifacts of
reporting?

N.b. Need use Brave with Tor to get annoymous access to statistics.  

TODO have a public web site proxy @TorNetwork requests in an IFRAME.
